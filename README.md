# Online Banking System, with python Flask

This is a simplified version of an online banking system, entirely with python Flask for the driver code and Html and css for the webpage design.
This includes features like:
* New Customer registration
* Existing Customer Login
* Money Withdraw & Deposit

<br>
For saving customer details, I have used json, instead of RDBMS.
